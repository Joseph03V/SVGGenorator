It can create three different shapes with all colors. Your logo name must be three letters long.

To use this project you have to open your terinal. In your terminal type the command "node index.js" 
you will then be prompted with a variety of questions reguarding your logo. After you answer all the
questions it will generate your logo and name the file based on the three letter text you

## future Implementations
In the future i'd love to add more shapes. I'd also like to look into more styling of the text.
